# Configuration file for the LircChannelChanger script
#
# Except for the configfile option, all other options
# specified on the command line can be specified in
# this file.  Comments ('#') are stripped, and options
# that are not prefixed with '--' have the '--' added.
#
# The main reason for supporting a configfile is
# that the command line for the LircChannelChanger script
# could exceed the 128 character (database) size limits
# if many options were specified (and fully typed out).
# In particular, the before or after commands with long
# remote strings.

remote          MotorolaDTA100-PaceDC50X   # lirc remote name
delay           .2          # .2 seconds is long enough for reliable tuning
rdelay          .2          # Add in .2 seconds for debounce compensation
                            # compensation (not clear if needed)
channeldigits   3           # Tunes faster with 3 digits (no timeout reqd)
digitprefix     KEY_        # lirc file has keys prefixed with KEY_
                            # so sending 0 requires the name KEY_0
beforekeys      KEY_INFO    # Return from extended info screen, if on it,
                            # otherwise this puts up the channel info,
                            # which you get anyway when tuning....
